# Arran

Hello, everything is recorded in the 'docs' document.

This was a project I used to practice with R, and familiarise myself with SIMD data (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation).

I don't pretend any of this is novel, or anything more than a superficial view of the data. But the principles of plotting using geom sf (from the development version of ggplot, tidyverse) can create incredible, intuitive chloropleths and types of visualisations of large complicated datasets.

Using the UK postcode data as well with geom point makes it incredibly easy to visualise geographical spread of data, which can be useful in a number of settings with/without the overlay of other information.

(For example, households in zones more than 2 hours away from a hospital).

The code to recreate this project is split between the documents 'Code', 'Map Code', 'Map5 Code', and 'front page graphics'.
With a little manipulation these diagrams and interactive maps can be adapted/recreated for any area of Scotland.

The project website https://fergustaylor.github.io/Arran/ is viewable from the README in 'docs'.
